We intentionally left this folder empty. 

1.	We originally planned our scripts for users with knowledge on working with bash, python and R. 
2.	The use of our bash+python scripts or Docker will automatically generate the latest version of database.csv. 

But we have received emails from users who (lack knowledge on python and bash and) read our preprint and want to try our scripts. 
Hence, to help such researchers without knowledge on bash/python, we have now uploaded the database.csv
